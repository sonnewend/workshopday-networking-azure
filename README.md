## Project - Deploy Hub-spoke Archicture (60 minutes)

Implement a Hub-spoke topology

   ![Screenshot of the Hub-spoke](/AllFiles/Images/Hub-Spoke.png)

**Important Notes**
- Three Virtual Networks;
- Gateway VPN on the Hub network;
- VNET Peering connection Hub to spoke and vice verse;
- VNET Peering connection in the hub to allow gateway transit;
- VNET Peering connection in each spokes to use remote gateways;
- Azure Bastion on the Hub network;
- Azure Firewall on the Hub network;
- Custom Route tables to address prefix "Address Space networking destination" and next hop type to virtual applicance;
- Network rule Azure Firewall all internal traffic.
